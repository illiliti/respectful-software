# Respectful Software

Is your software respectful to its community?

Since neither OSS nor FOSS define how to work with a community, here is an
attempt to fill that gap with some unspoken rules that many projects follow.

The following rules uses [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)
to define MUST, SHOULD, etc.

1. Software MUST be (FL)OSS
- End of story. If your software isn't (FL)OSS, it is disrespectful already.

2. Software MUST be friendly to the community
- That is, software MUST provide a way to contribute, report a bug or ask for
  a new feature.

3. Software MUST NOT charge contributors
- Contributors are those people who fix bugs and add new features to your
  software. In return, software MUST respect them.

4. Software MUST NOT force contributors to sign a CLA
- Consider using the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) instead if you really
  need one. In most cases you don't.

5. Software MUST NOT have tracking/telemetry
- Software that acts like spyware is disrespectful to everyone, or rather
  malicious.

6. Software SHOULD NOT have a CoC/Contributor Covenant
- A CoC is usually enforced to ban people who disagree with political decisions
  that software maintainers make. Thus, software maintainers MUST NOT ban people
  who disagree with political decisions, or those who disagree in general.

- Even if your software needs a CoC for a good reason, it is still disrespectful
  to the community. It's a matter of trust. Do you trust and respect
  your community? If you do, then a CoC is unnecessary. Stop attempting to
  regulate anyone and especially enforce dumb rules. It is highly unwelcome to
  everyone. It brings no value to the development process. It makes it hard to
  communicate with software maintainers **respectfully** since a CoC indicates
  that they have no respect for the community in the first place. Keep this in
  mind if you're going to add a CoC.

7. Software SHOULD NOT be hosted on a proprietary platform
- Remember, if your software is hosted on a proprietary platform, that platform
  MUST NOT require personal information. See below.

8. Software MUST NOT demand personal information
- Such as real name, address, phone number and so on. This information is
  directly attached to you and your real life. Thus, software MUST respect
  your decision to not give any kind of personal information that can be used
  to track you down and harm you in any possible way.
