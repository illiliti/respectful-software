# Respectful Software

Is your software respectful to its community?

Since neither OSS nor FOSS define how to work with community, here is an
attempt to fill that gap with some basic rules that many projects unspokenly
follow already.

The following rules uses [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)
to define MUST, SHOULD, etc terms.

1. Software MUST be (FL)OSS
- End of story. If your software isn't (FL)OSS, it is disrespectful already.

2. Software MUST respect and work with community
- Thus, software MUST provide a way to contribute, report a bug and ask for
  a new feature.

3. Software MUST NOT charge contributors
- Contributors are those people who fixes bugs and adds new features to your
  software. In return, software MUST respect them.

4. Software MUST NOT force contributors to sign CLA
- Consider using DCO instead if you really need one. In most cases you don't.

5. Software MUST NOT have tracking/telemetry
- Software that act like a spyware is disrespectful to everyone, or rather
  malicious.

6. Software SHOULD NOT have CoC/Contributor Covenant
- CoC is usually being enforced to ban people who disagrees with political
  decisions that software makes. Thus, software MUST NOT ban people who
  disagrees with political decisions, and who disagrees in general.

- Even if your software needs CoC for a good reason, it is still disrespectful
  to the community. CoC basically treats **tech-savvy** people, people who are
  highly intelligent, like a normies who don't understand that red is red and
  green is green. If you're going to add CoC, make sure nobody interpret it
  like that.

7. Software SHOULD NOT use proprietary platform for development
- Remember, if your software uses proprietary platform, that platform MUST NOT
  require personal information. See below.

8. Software MUST NOT demand personal information
- Even requiring real name is disrespectful. Software MUST respect people's
  decision to not give any kind of personal information.
