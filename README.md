# Respectful Software

Is your software respectful to its community?

Since neither OSS nor FOSS define how to work with community, here is an
attempt to fill that gap with some basic rules that many projects unspokenly
follow.

The following rules uses [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt)
to define MUST, SHOULD, etc.

1. Software MUST be (FL)OSS
- End of story. If your software isn't (FL)OSS, it is disrespectful already.

2. Software MUST respect and work with community
- Thus, software MUST provide a way to contribute, report a bug and ask for
  a new feature.

3. Software MUST NOT charge contributors
- Contributors are those people who fixes bugs and adds new features to your
  software. In return, software MUST respect them.

4. Software MUST NOT force contributors to sign CLA
- Consider using [DCO](https://developercertificate.org) instead if you really
  need one. In most cases you don't.

5. Software MUST NOT have tracking/telemetry
- Software that act like a spyware is disrespectful to everyone, or rather
  malicious.

6. Software SHOULD NOT have CoC/Contributor Covenant
- CoC is usually being enforced to ban people who disagrees with political
  decisions that software makes. Thus, software MUST NOT ban people who
  disagrees with political decisions, and who disagrees in general.

- Even if your software needs CoC for a good reason, it is still disrespectful
  to the community. It's a matter of trust. Do you trust and respect your
  community? If you do, then throw away CoC. Stop attempting to regulate anyone
  and especially enforce dumb rules. It is highly unwelcome to everyone. It
  brings no value to the development process. It makes it hard to communicate
  with software author **respectfully** since CoC has no respect to the
  community in the first place. Keep this in mind if you're going to add CoC.

7. Software SHOULD NOT use proprietary platform for development
- Remember, if your software uses proprietary platform, that platform MUST NOT
  require personal information. See below.

8. Software MUST NOT demand personal information
- Such as real name, address, phone number and so on. This information directly
  attached to you and your real life. Thus, software MUST respect your decision
  to not give any kind of personal information that can be used to track you
  down and harm you in any possible way.
